# Kickstarting with Excel
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to assist up and coming playwright, Louise, with establishing a successful Kickstarter program for her play, "Fever," by 
comparing it to similar Kickstarter campaigns.  Raw data has been obtained of a sample of Kickstarter campaigns comprising multiple categories and project
types.  This information has been organized, sorted, and analyzed to identify potential factors that can influence a given program's success.  Trends
were identified so as to assist Louise with identifying similar programs and "mirroring" those that have shown to be successful.
