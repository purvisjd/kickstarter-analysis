# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to assist up and coming playwright, Louise, with establishing a successful Kickstarter program for play by comparing it
to similar Kickstarter campaigns.  Raw data has been obtained of a sample of Kickstarter campaigns comprising multiple categories and project types.
This information has been organized, sorted, and analyzed to identify potential factors that can influence a given program's success.  Trends were 
identified to assist Louise with identifying similar programs and "mirroring" those that have shown to be successful.
