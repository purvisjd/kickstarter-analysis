# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to assist up and coming playwright, Louise, with establishing a successful Kickstarter program for play by comparing it
to similar Kickstarter campaigns.  Raw data has been obtained of a sample of Kickstarter campaigns comprising multiple categories and project types.
This information has been organized, sorted, and analyzed to identify potential factors that can influence a given program's success.  Trends were 
identified to assist Louise with identifying similar programs and "mirroring" those that have shown to be successful.

## Analysis and Challenges
Raw data was obtained and then focused to reflect four primary factors in order to be more applicable to Louise's identified goals:  Kickstarter programs 
that were focused on theater, specifically plays, the identified goals and pledges of those programs, the timeframe given to the campaign, and the ultimate
outcome (success vs failure) of those campaigns.  Utilizing these categories of information, it was possible to identify specific inlfuential factors for 
campaign succcess.

The data obtained from Kickstarter was loaded into an Excel spreadsheet (Kickstarter tab).  The information on this tab was sorted and further clarfied
by separating the categories into both parent and subcategory, as well as converting the Unix timestamp into a readable format.
